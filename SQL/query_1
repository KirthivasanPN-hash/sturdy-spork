MySQL practice problems 

SELF JOIN
1. The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. 
Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'

SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' and stopb.name='LondonRoad'


Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Sighthill.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

SELECT DISTINCT a.num, a.company, stopb.name ,  c.num,  c.company
FROM route a JOIN route b
ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)

JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)

WHERE  stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart' AND stopd.name = 'Sighthill'
            AND  stopb.name = stopc.name
ORDER BY LENGTH(a.num), b.num, stopb.id, LENGTH(c.num), d.num
