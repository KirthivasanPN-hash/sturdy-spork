8. Removing a commit from the pull request by force pushing it
    
    * If you want to remove a commit from the pull request or delete a commmit then using git log command retrieve the git has code. 

    * Use git reset (hash_code) 

    *  By resetting the commit will get unstaged

    *  Alternatively, using  (git add .) then git stash it will be gone

    * You check this in log #git log

    * now online repo has something extra that ur local repo doesn't so you need force push it.

    * git origin branch_name - f


9. Merging a pull request   
    * This technically means that you request for changes made in local branch to merge in upstream master branch 
    da

    * Just accept the merge request and vola! it is merged!
 

10. Making forked project even with main project

    *  You encounter this when a person requests a pull request and it get merged in the upstream repo. 

    * To view the commits in local repo either you can select fetch upstream  to view in main (master) branch or 
    (own fork and upstream repo is always maintained)
            
            * git checkout main branch
            
            * type git fetch --all --prune

            * git reset --hard upstream/main
           
            *  U can check it using git log

            * git push origin master (to reflect in online repo)

            or in one line which is #git pull upstream# main make sure you checkout the main branch.

            * then make sure u push it to onine repo


11. Squashing commits

    * git log indicates which all commits that u want squash into single commit

    * git rebase -i commit has code till the one u want merge the commits

    *  select the commit u want to squash in the env and merge them with a message

    *  create a message by pressing :x  and quit the env by pressing esc and :wq

    * If u want the commits from the log then, ##git reset --hard commit hash_code should be cautious with this code.


12. Merge conflicts and how to resolve them?

    * Person A performs a pull request and then person B makes the changes using the commit method.

    * The author of the repo can manual override it and resolve it.
