Static vs Dynamic Langauges

1. Static 
    * Perform type checking at compile time
    * Errors will show at compile time
    * Declare datatype before u use it 
    * More control

2. Dynamic

    * Perform type checking at runtime
    * Errors might not show till program is running
    * No need to declare datatype of variables
    * Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime

int a  = 10

Simple logic: a stored in Stack and 10 stored in Heap

# more than one ref var can point to the same object 

# if value for one ref var is changed then the original value is also changed and affects other ref vars that are point to this object

# objects do not have refer variable pointing to them then it goes for garbage collection
